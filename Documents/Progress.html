         <h1> Description</h1>
          <p>Our project plan “Fit&Slim” started with the idea from the current pandemic situation. As we all were going through different ideas and were planning about the project, we noticed that every second person from a family was saying that they have started eating unhealthy which eventually has resulted into obesity. Keeping this in mind that every person has started gaining extra kilos, we came with the idea that we should make something related to the fitness. As technology is the best tool for this issue, so we started searching up what is already there on the internet and what kind of things we should put in our project to make it success and more useful than other websites out there. As per this lockdown situation, we noticed that people has started consuming frozen and junk food. This unhealthy habit eventually resulted in poor health conditions and creating more health-related problems. So, we initially decided to build a healthy recipe website which will provide people healthy and tasty recipes which will be easy to cook at home. But as we surveyed across the different websites, we noticed that providing only recipes cannot work for maintaining good health we need to put more features. After lots of working out, we finally decided to build a website which will provide lots of different services to users which will help them to maintain their health from all the different aspects. We then included fitness products, goal setter and tracker along with many exciting services through our website. </p>
          <p>First of all, we decided the different features which we were going to implement. We decided for the minimal viable features which are the backbone of the website. These features include adding products into cart, providing services page which will allow user access to cardio and other workout facilities. Login page will help to keep the information of the user secured along with this the features of the website includes bookings with the trainers who will provide one on one guidance to all the customers. Diet plans and exercise videos will also play exceptional role in providing health benefit to the costumers. Workout tracker and goal setter will help in setting up the daily goals along with achieving them daily.</p>
          <p> So, in order to start up the actual website, we first decided to build the design for the website. After lots of changes and amendments we finalised the whole structure for the website and started to implement them. All the team members were happy with the initial design made. After we started to build the website we realised that building up design first was a good idea because we were having the whole idea that how the website is going to look. So, it was easy to build the actual website using the same design which was made earlier. Each and everything were well planned and everything has gone according to our plan. All the targets were achieved within the allotted time and regular feedbacks further improved the website design. </p>
          <h1>Outcomes to date</h1>
          <p>After finalising all the designs for the website, finally we started building the actual website. We built the products page in which our website will provide recipe books, various fitness products, and many more things. This products page will provide the customer the detailed description of each product. The customer is able to add the products to cart to purchase them. The user will also have access to services page which will allow them to get various services like workout videos and many more. There will be login page through which the user can have personal access using their credentials which will keep their personal information safe. The goal setter will help to set a target goal for the person to achieve in a time span. Feedback feature will help the user to further improve the performance and can benefit them more. Further, workout tracker will provide the user daily feedback and additional tips to further improve the performance in order to achieve the target.</p>
          
          <h1>Extended Viable Features</h1>
          <p>As per the busy schedules in today’s era, users can order food based on their diet by clicking on order food, there will be plans if they want to follow for example 30 days plan, breakfast lunch and dinner will be delivered, it is really helpful for the users who are unable to cook. This feature can help to maintain the healthy diet as due to  shortage of time people often ends up eating junk and ready-made food that can be unhealthy and can stop a person from achieving their target. So, here comes this feature which will provide healthy food at your doorstep. </p>
          
          <p>When everything will get back to normal. Gym plays a very vital role in manifolding health benefits. GPS tracking will help to see if the GYMs are available. This feature can help to provide memberships and bookings with the gyms. This will help the users to get the availability of the gyms at one click and according to suitable time. </p>
          
          <p>Another feature includes booking with trainers, as personal guidance is very important which can tell what things a person needs to improve in order to get their things on right track. Users can get regular feedbacks and guidance from the personal trainer by booking one on one appointment. Personal feedbacks from the trainers can help users to get more benefit. </p>
          
          <h1>Scope creep</h1>
          <p>Initially we started to build a recipe website which can help people to make healthy food at home using ingredients which are available at home. But we found that providing only recipes cannot make this project a success and we decided some more engaging features in order to get more user attraction and users can rely on our website which can provide them full support from all the healthy aspects. So, we added more features like login page for personal information to be stored securely. Goal setter and tracker was introduced to keep the users motivated for physical workout also. Services page was setup to provide various kind of support to users to keep them in touch with different and exciting workouts in this quarantine situation in which we were allowed only little amount of outdoor activity. From the products page the user can get various options like purchasing the products as well as getting the membership as per their convenience. Every team member provided feedback which helped to improve the things further. So, finally from recipe website we ended up building a very useful website which had lots of exiting features to get the users engaged with healthy practices.

          <h1>Difficulties</h1>
          <p>We all as a group had enough knowledge to create the webpage for the assignment report purpose. As most of the members have done ‘Intro to IT’ in last semester so, creating webpages were easy this time. We all were familiar with the AWS and Github repositories, therefore assignment 1 was really decent for all of us. In this subject we didn’t expected that we need to show the fully functional product as a final result. So, this was bit unexpected, as we were assuming to show only half functional product. After, working out for the final features, first we created the design for the features. But, here comes the ultimate challenge for all of us. We all did lots of assumptions for how all the features will look and work. The challenge we encountered was that how we will get all these assumed features to be working. As making a plan is really easy but the actual implementation of that required lots of efforts and long hours of study with experiments. To implement all the features we decided, advance level programming like php, bootstrap and JavaScript was needed, as we all are 1st year students so our programming level was not that good.   Finally, we made it all work step by step by experimenting with different things and working on our programming skills. The areas in which we have starched is creating excellent designs. We all worked on making the designs as much as user friendly so that users can get familiar with all the functions within small span of time moreover, we have enhanced our programming skills. </p>
          
          <h1>Challenges Expected</h1>
          <p>The most challenging thing was Time Management. As a group we all need to have constant review and track that everyone is doing right things at right time. But this was not easy especially in remote learning. Various sorts of issues used to create hurdles and interruptions. Internet cut out, non-availability of members and any personal issues used to create intermissions. Keeping the whole group together was a challenge. Most of the times during group meetings 1 or 2 members used to miss the meetings because of some personal reasons or sometimes they didn’t check their calendars for the scheduled meetings. So, to overcome this we used to ask every member about their availability for the group meeting. And when everyone used to post their availability time in the group chat, then a meeting was scheduled. This measure solved our problem up to some extend as meeting was setup on the availability time of every group member so that all the members can attend the meeting at their convenience.</p>
          
          <h1>New Skills and Experiences</h1>
          <p>We have developed more programming skills as in order to make all the features working lots of programming skills were required. So, working for that has helped us to acquire good knowledge and enhanced our skills. Moreover, creating mock-ups was also a new experience for us. Making the initial design for the website was really interesting part through which we have acquired efficient designing skills also. Using trello board for all the assignment updates was also a new experience. Moreover, we have learned how to collaborate a team in more efficient way. As in the starting, we were not able to cope up due to some issues but later now managing things in a way that suits everyone worked a lot for us. And this time we not only have to design the features but also have to implement them fully which was bit tricky and new experience for us. </p>
          
          <h1>Plans</h1>
          <p>Plans are more likely to change, whenever we start implementing better things in the actual project. So, the same happened with us. When we were at the beginning of the project we decided to build a healthy eating recipe website. But while exploring the other products in the market we came with the idea of adding more interesting things to make this project more interesting and user friendly. As our project is based on helping people to eat healthy food and to maintain their BMI (Body Mass Index) which was not possible by providing diet only. Physical exercise and healthy routine plays a vital role in controlling body weight. Talking about timetable, most of the tasks took more than actual time to complete which was really tricky thing to handle. But as per now, everything is on right track and every member is doing their part so there is no need to make further changes into anything. Most of the things were as expected but while implementing the design for the website that we made earlier, we were not able to implement it as such. So, we made many changes to the design to get the desired outcome. We will not make much changes if we have further time as our project is satisfactory to all the team members and we have executed all the features in the best way we can.</p>
