  <h2>PROJECT PROGRESSES<h2>
      <h2> Description</h2>
      <p>Our project plan “Fit&Slim” started with the idea from the current pandemic situation. As we all were going
        through different ideas and were planning about the project, we noticed that every second person from a family
        was saying that they have started eating unhealthy which eventually has resulted into obesity. Keeping this in
        mind that every person has started gaining extra kilos, we came with the idea that we should make something
        related to the fitness. As technology is the best tool for this issue, so we started searching up what is
        already there on the internet and what kind of things we should put in our project to make it success and more
        useful than other websites out there. As per this lockdown situation, we noticed that people has started
        consuming frozen and junk food. This unhealthy habit eventually resulted in poor health conditions and creating
        more health-related problems. So, we initially decided to build a healthy recipe website which will provide
        people healthy and tasty recipes which will be easy to cook at home. But as we surveyed across the different
        websites, we noticed that providing only recipes cannot work for maintaining good health we need to put more
        features. After lots of working out, we finally decided to build a website which will provide lots of different
        services to users which will help them to maintain their health from all the different aspects. We then included
        fitness products, goal setter and tracker along with many exciting services through our website. </p>
      <p>First of all, we decided the different features which we were going to implement. We decided for the minimal
        viable features which are the backbone of the website. These features include adding products into cart,
        providing services page which will allow user access to cardio and other workout facilities. Login page will
        help to keep the information of the user secured along with this the features of the website includes bookings
        with the trainers who will provide one on one guidance to all the customers. Diet plans and exercise videos will
        also play exceptional role in providing health benefit to the costumers. Workout tracker and goal setter will
        help in setting up the daily goals along with achieving them daily.</p>
      <p> So, in order to start up the actual website, we first decided to build the design for the website. After lots
        of changes and amendments we finalised the whole structure for the website and started to implement them. All
        the team members were happy with the initial design made. After we started to build the website we realised that
        building up design first was a good idea because we were having the whole idea that how the website is going to
        look. So, it was easy to build the actual website using the same design which was made earlier. Each and
        everything were well planned and everything has gone according to our plan. All the targets were achieved within
        the allotted time and regular feedbacks further improved the website design. </p>
      <h2>Outcomes to date</h2>
      <p>After finalising all the designs for the website, finally we started building the actual website. We built the
        products page in which our website will provide recipe books, various fitness products, and many more things.
        This products page will provide the customer the detailed description of each product. The customer is able to
        add the products to cart to purchase them. The user will also have access to services page which will allow them
        to get various services like workout videos and many more. There will be login page through which the user can
        have personal access using their credentials which will keep their personal information safe. The goal setter
        will help to set a target goal for the person to achieve in a time span. Feedback feature will help the user to
        further improve the performance and can benefit them more. Further, workout tracker will provide the user daily
        feedback and additional tips to further improve the performance in order to achieve the target.</p>

          <h1>Scope creep</h1>
          <p>Initially we started to build a recipe website which can help people to make healthy food at home using ingredients which are available at home. But we found that providing only recipes cannot make this project a success and we decided some more engaging features in order to get more user attraction and users can rely on our website which can provide them full support from all the healthy aspects. So, we added more features like login page for personal information to be stored securely. Goal setter and tracker was introduced to keep the users motivated for physical workout also. Services page was setup to provide various kind of support to users to keep them in touch with different and exciting workouts in this quarantine situation in which we were allowed only little amount of outdoor activity. From the products page the user can get various options like purchasing the products as well as getting the membership as per their convenience. Every team member provided feedback which helped to improve the things further. So, finally from recipe website we ended up building a very useful website which had lots of exiting features to get the users engaged with healthy practices.
