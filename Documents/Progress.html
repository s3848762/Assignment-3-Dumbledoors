         <h1> Description</h1>
          <p>Our project plan “Fit&Slim” started with the idea from the current pandemic situation. As we all were going through different ideas and were planning about the project, we noticed that every second person from a family was saying that they have started eating unhealthy which eventually has resulted into obesity. Keeping this in mind that every person has started gaining extra kilos, we came with the idea that we should make something related to the fitness. As technology is the best tool for this issue, so we started searching up what is already there on the internet and what kind of things we should put in our project to make it success and more useful than other websites out there. As per this lockdown situation, we noticed that people has started consuming frozen and junk food. This unhealthy habit eventually resulted in poor health conditions and creating more health-related problems. So, we initially decided to build a healthy recipe website which will provide people healthy and tasty recipes which will be easy to cook at home. But as we surveyed across the different websites, we noticed that providing only recipes cannot work for maintaining good health we need to put more features. After lots of working out, we finally decided to build a website which will provide lots of different services to users which will help them to maintain their health from all the different aspects. We then included fitness products, goal setter and tracker along with many exciting services through our website. </p>
          <p>First of all, we decided the different features which we were going to implement. We decided for the minimal viable features which are the backbone of the website. These features include adding products into cart, providing services page which will allow user access to cardio and other workout facilities. Login page will help to keep the information of the user secured along with this the features of the website includes bookings with the trainers who will provide one on one guidance to all the customers. Diet plans and exercise videos will also play exceptional role in providing health benefit to the costumers. Workout tracker and goal setter will help in setting up the daily goals along with achieving them daily.</p>
          <p> So, in order to start up the actual website, we first decided to build the design for the website. After lots of changes and amendments we finalised the whole structure for the website and started to implement them. All the team members were happy with the initial design made. After we started to build the website we realised that building up design first was a good idea because we were having the whole idea that how the website is going to look. So, it was easy to build the actual website using the same design which was made earlier. Each and everything were well planned and everything has gone according to our plan. All the targets were achieved within the allotted time and regular feedbacks further improved the website design. </p>
