        <h2> Description</h2>
        <p>Our project plan “Fit&Slim” started with the idea from the current pandemic situation. As we all were going through different ideas and were planning about the project, we noticed that every second person from a family was saying that they have
            started eating unhealthy which eventually has resulted into obesity. Keeping this in mind that every person has started gaining extra kilos, we came with the idea that we should make something related to the fitness. As technology is the best
            tool for this issue, so we started searching up what is already there on the internet and what kind of things we should put in our project to make it success and more useful than other websites out there. As per this lockdown situation, we
            noticed that people has started consuming frozen and junk food. This unhealthy habit eventually resulted in poor health conditions and creating more health-related problems. So, we initially decided to build a healthy recipe website which
            will provide people healthy and tasty recipes which will be easy to cook at home. But as we surveyed across the different websites, we noticed that providing only recipes cannot work for maintaining good health we need to put more features.
            After lots of working out, we finally decided to build a website which will provide lots of different services to users which will help them to maintain their health from all the different aspects. We then included fitness products, goal setter
            and tracker along with many exciting services through our website. </p>
        <p>First of all, we decided the different features which we were going to implement. We decided for the minimal viable features which are the backbone of the website. These features include adding products into cart, providing services page which
            will allow user access to cardio and other workout facilities. Login page will help to keep the information of the user secured along with this the features of the website includes bookings with the trainers who will provide one on one guidance
            to all the customers. Diet plans and exercise videos will also play exceptional role in providing health benefit to the costumers. Workout tracker and goal setter will help in setting up the daily goals along with achieving them daily.</p>
        <p> So, in order to start up the actual website, we first decided to build the design for the website. After lots of changes and amendments we finalised the whole structure for the website and started to implement them. All the team members were happy
            with the initial design made. After we started to build the website we realised that building up design first was a good idea because we were having the whole idea that how the website is going to look. So, it was easy to build the actual
            website using the same design which was made earlier. Each and everything were well planned and everything has gone according to our plan. All the targets were achieved within the allotted time and regular feedbacks further improved the website
            design. </p>
        <h2>Outcomes to date</h2>
        <p>Outcome of our project is quite successful and is in the way we wanted the result to be. By implementing all the minimal viable features, first we have login page which we are going to demonstrate in the presentation. The login page will help the users to access their account with their unique username and password. In case of new users, this page asks them to enter their username, email, password, date of birth and gender in order to register. All of the fields are necessary in order to register. If the user tries to register without filling in a required field, an error message will pop up which will prevent the user to register. </p>
<p>The second minimal viable feature is the products’ page. The product’s page allows the users to select from the wide variety of products that Fit&Slim offers. That includes offering healthy recipe books all the way up to nutritious healthy energy bars, juices, and soups. We have also included in an extra feature (the search bar), which would allow the user to easily locate their desired option.
Next minimum viable feature is the services page, where we offer the users the services such as online trainers, work-out trackers and food, goal setter and diet plans. These are the three main services we offer to cater for the needs of our client which will allow them to look after their health during quarantine.</p>
<p>Next Minimal Viable feature is the workout-tacker which is one of the most significant features of the website. It allows the users to record and add the duration of the following: walk, sleep, cycling, work-out and calories.</p>
<p>Our last minimal viable feature is the goal setter and the feedback. This page is split int two, the first is the “Set Your Goal” and the other one is the “Feedback” section. The first section allows the users to name their goal and describe what it is as well as when they would like to achieve that goal. Once the user clicks on submit, a summary of what they have entered would show up which will act as a reminder of what needs to be achieved. The second section of the same page presents the users with the opportunity to provide themselves with some feedback as to what extent they were able to achieve their goal. This acts as a really good form of self-reflection as it allows the users to reflect upon what they have achieved and to what extent.</p>
<p>Lastly our extended feature is the check-out page which allows the users to purchase the product by adding their personal details in order to successfully place their order. The fields that must be filled in are the following: name, email, home address, city, state, zip code, card number, expiry month, year and cvv. Once all the necessary fields are filled, they are able to place their order. However, it is an extended feature, which means that this was one of the most challenging feature that we had to implement.

        <h2>Extended Viable Features</h2>
        <p>As per the busy schedules in today’s era, users can order food based on their diet by clicking on order food, there will be plans if they want to follow for example 30 days plan, breakfast lunch and dinner will be delivered, it is really helpful
            for the users who are unable to cook. This feature can help to maintain the healthy diet as due to shortage of time people often ends up eating junk and ready-made food that can be unhealthy and can stop a person from achieving their target.
            So, here comes this feature which will provide healthy food at your doorstep. </p>

        <p>When everything will get back to normal. Gym plays a very vital role in manifolding health benefits. GPS tracking will help to see if the GYMs are available. This feature can help to provide memberships and bookings with the gyms. This will help
            the users to get the availability of the gyms at one click and according to suitable time. </p>

        <p>Another feature includes booking with trainers, as personal guidance is very important which can tell what things a person needs to improve in order to get their things on right track. Users can get regular feedbacks and guidance from the personal
            trainer by booking one on one appointment. Personal feedbacks from the trainers can help users to get more benefit. </p>

        <h2>Scope creep</h2>
        <p>Initially we started to build a recipe website which can help people to make healthy food at home using ingredients which are available at home. But we found that providing only recipes cannot make this project a success and we decided some more
            engaging features in order to get more user attraction and users can rely on our website which can provide them full support from all the healthy aspects. So, we added more features like login page for personal information to be stored securely.
            Goal setter and tracker was introduced to keep the users motivated for physical workout also. Services page was setup to provide various kind of support to users to keep them in touch with different and exciting workouts in this quarantine
            situation in which we were allowed only little amount of outdoor activity. From the products page the user can get various options like purchasing the products as well as getting the membership as per their convenience. Every team member provided
            feedback which helped to improve the things further. So, finally from recipe website we ended up building a very useful website which had lots of exiting features to get the users engaged with healthy practices.

        </p>
        <h2>Windfall</h2>
        <p>We have divided the whole assignment into different parts among the whole group in order to complete the whole project on time. We have divided our whole team into 2 part . One group worked on design and other worked on initial development of
            the website. In this way the workload was evenly divided and tasks were completed on time. This strategy helped to obtain the desired outcome on time and also helped in completing all the tasks successfully</p>
