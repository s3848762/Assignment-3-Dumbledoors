        <p>
            The first minimal viable feature is the login page, users of Fit&Slim are able to login to their
            account only if they are already registered with the website. They are simply asked to enter their
            username and password to successfully login. Additionally, if they have forgotten their password,
            they are able to click on the forgotten password link which takes them to the following page.
        </p>
        <img class="mvf" src="Images/Screenshot (225).png" alt="">
        <p>
            Here the user is able to recover their password by providing their email. This way they will be able to rest
            their password without having to face any difficulties which therefore promotes ease of use to the users.
        </p>
        <img class="mvf" src="Images/Screenshot (226).png" alt="">
        <p>
            Additionally, the login page allows those who have not yet registered to register. This feature expands are
            niche market as we are open to anyone who would like to join. This page asks them to enter their username,
            email, password, date of birth and gender in order to register. All of the fields are necessary in order to
            register. If the user tries to register without filling in a required field, an error message will pop up
            which will prevent the user to register. This is shown in the following screenshot.
        </p>
        <img class="mvf" src="Images/Screenshot (228).png" alt="">
        <p>
            The second minimal viable feature is the products’ page. The product’s page allows the users to select from
            the wide variety of products that Fit&Slim offers. That includes offering healthy recipe books all the way
            up to nutritious healthy energy bars, juices, and soups. We have also included in an extra feature (the
            search bar), which would allow the user to easily locate their desired option.

        </p>
        <img class="mvf" src="Images/Screenshot (229).png" alt="">
        <p>
            The following screenshot is off the search bar in action. If we type soup, all of the relevant options will
            pop up while the other options will disappear.
        </p>
        <img class="mvf" src="Images/Screenshot (230).png" alt="">
        <p>
            Additionally, the user is able to click on a specific product and find more about its detail such as the
            price and additionally can select the quantity of that particular product. The following screenshot provides
            how the page would look like if the user clicks on the recipe book. They are able to select the quantity and
            add that product to their cart. This page further provides the detailed description of the recipe book as
            well as the price of the product.
        </p>
        <img class="mvf" src="Images/Screenshot (231).png" alt="">
        <p>
            Next minimum viable feature is the services page, where we offer the users the services such as online
            trainers, work-out trackers and food, goal setter and diet plans. These are the three main services we offer
            to cater for the needs of our client which will allow them to look after their health during quarantine. The
            following screenshot shows how the services page looks like:
        </p>
        <img class="mvf" src="Images/Screenshot (232).png" alt="">
        <p>
            If the user clicks on the food and diet plan, they are only able to view the service if they are registered
            with Fit&Slim, if they are not registered then they would be asked to register by clicking on “try again”,
            which will re-direct them to the registration page.
        </p>
        <img class="mvf" src="Images/Screenshot (233).png" alt="">

        <img class="mvf" src="Images/Screenshot (234).png" alt="">
        <p>
            When the user clicks on “try again”, then they will be re-directed to the login page, in order to access the
            full details and services.
        </p>
        <img class="mvf" src="Images/Screenshot (235).png" alt="">
        <p>
            Next Minimal Viable feature is the workout-tacker which is one of the most significant features of the
            website. It allows the users to record and add the duration of the following: walk, sleep, cycling, work-out
            and calories. Once the user enters all of the necessary fields, a personalized and customized summary would
            pop up and this can be seen in the following screenshot.
        </p>
        <img class="mvf" src="Images/Screenshot (236).png" alt="">
        <p>
            If the user wants to add more, they wont be able to unless they are logged in. So an error message would pop
            up which will ask the user to log in if they would like to add more. The following screenshot provides the
            need for the user to log in.
        </p>
        <img class="mvf" src="Images/Screenshot (238).png" alt="">
        <p>
            Our last minimal viable feature is the goal setter and the feedback. This page is split int two, the first
            is the “Set Your Goal” and the other one is the “Feedback” section. The first section allows the users to
            name their goal and describe what it is as well as when they would like to achieve that goal. Once the user
            clicks on submit, a summary of what they have entered would show up which will act as a reminder of what
            needs to be achieved. The second section of the same page presents the users with the opportunity to provide
            themselves with some feedback as to what extent they were able to achieve their goal. This acts as a really
            good form of self-reflection as it allows the users to reflect upon what they have achieved and to what
            extent.
        </p>

        <img class="mvf" src="Images/Screenshot (240).png" alt="">
        <p>
            Lastly our extended feature is the check-out page which allows the users to purchase the product by adding
            their personal details in order to successfully place their order. The fields that must be filled in are the
            following: name, email, home address, city, state, zip code, card number, expiry month, year and cvv. Once
            all the necessary fields are filled, they are able to place their order. However, it is an extended feature,
            which means that this was one of the most challenging feature that we had to implement. Therefore it works
            to a certain extent as they are able confirm their order but nothing happens after that.
        </p>
