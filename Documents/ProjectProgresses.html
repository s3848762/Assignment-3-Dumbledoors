        <p>
          Working in a group requires a great amount of commitment and devotion. Creating a group project in a team is
          quite a bit of a challenge especially when we have limited amount of time and resources to work with. Due to
          this pandemic, we did not attend face to face classes due to which we had to carry out all our discussions and
          meeting via Microsoft Teams. Not being able to physically work together on a project is quite stressing but
          with the exceptional team that we had, we overcome all the hurdles together. What I learned about the group
          projects is that they can reinforce skills that are relevant to both group and individual work, including the
          ability to break complex tasks into much smaller parts and steps. It further allows one to plan and manage
          time more efficiently which allows greater things to be achieved. Working in a group further refines
          understanding through discussion and explanation which reduces ambiguity and any doubts. Things that have
          worked exceptionally well is the level of work produced by each and every member of the team. No matter what
          tasks were assigned to each member, they adequately fulfilled each of the requirements to the best of their
          ability. At the same time, what did not go as well as we had expected was that we all struggled with managing
          our time properly. Even through all the members submitted their tasks on time, some of them would usually
          start working on the very last minute which would cause heaps of panic, creating a stressful environment.
          However, we got through the assignment by working together and supporting each other in critical time so no
          one feels overwhelmed about the work. <br><br>
          We made use of our amazing tutor, Trevor through our weekly consultation/meeting with him where we used to
          present our work and he would provide us with feedback to further improve the project. He has offered immense
          useful feedback and support such as how we could further enhance the website to offer maximum functionality to
          the users all the way up to how we could prepare ourselves to effectively present our project at the end of
          the semester in front of the lecture and in the video presentation. Additionally, we have equally benefited
          from the talks/discussion from our lecture where he guided us even more in terms of how we could make our
          project stand out amongst the others. For instance, we didn’t think of creating extra ordinary features such
          as workout trackers or goal setter but through the discussion we had with the lecture, he motivated us to go
          beyond our current skills and knowledge to develop an innovative feature.<br><br>
          Our group aimed for meeting twice every week for almost 30 minutes on top of the weekly meeting with our
          mentor. We carried our discussion via Microsoft Teams where we enabled our video and audio to effectively
          communicate our ideas and provide feedback to each other. Not being able to physically meet did not hinder us
          from carrying out useful discussion as we used the online medium to ensure that the current situation did not
          impact on our performance. There hasn’t been any significant changes that we observed but we rather observed
          is the fact that as we came closer to the end of the project, all of our group members were hyped up about the
          project as they saw the project form from nothing to an absolute delight.<br><br>
          We believe that there are two most important aspects of planning an organising a project which are managing
          time as well as having the adequate skills and knowledge to start a project. With these two things managed
          appropriately, we believe that there is no hurdle that could come in anyone’s way. In our project, prior
          knowledge of having programming experience came in a lot handy as we didn’t struggle with setting up a basic
          website which I believe would have been immensely hard if our team didn’t have any prior knowledge. From my
          perspective and based on the discussions we had carried with my team members what we could do differently and
          more effectively next time is to manage our time more efficiently to reduce panic that is usually caused right
          before our submission is due as we are finalizing things at the last moment.<br><br>
          The advice that I would give to my team members in starting a new project is to continuously show the exact
          same commitment and devotion that they have shown in this group project. Additionally, I would also urge them
          to keep up the great level of enthusiasm in introducing innovate ideas to improve the overall performance of
          the project.
