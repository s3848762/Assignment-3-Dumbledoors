          <h1>Difficulties</h1>
          <p>We all as a group had enough knowledge to create the webpage for the assignment report purpose. As most of the members have done ‘Intro to IT’ in last semester so, creating webpages were easy this time. We all were familiar with the AWS and Github repositories, therefore assignment 1 was really decent for all of us. In this subject we didn’t expected that we need to show the fully functional product as a final result. So, this was bit unexpected, as we were assuming to show only half functional product. After, working out for the final features, first we created the design for the features. But, here comes the ultimate challenge for all of us. We all did lots of assumptions for how all the features will look and work. The challenge we encountered was that how we will get all these assumed features to be working. As making a plan is really easy but the actual implementation of that required lots of efforts and long hours of study with experiments. To implement all the features we decided, advance level programming like php, bootstrap and JavaScript was needed, as we all are 1st year students so our programming level was not that good.   Finally, we made it all work step by step by experimenting with different things and working on our programming skills. The areas in which we have starched is creating excellent designs. We all worked on making the designs as much as user friendly so that users can get familiar with all the functions within small span of time moreover, we have enhanced our programming skills. </p>
          
          <h1>Challenges Expected</h1>
          <p>The most challenging thing was Time Management. As a group we all need to have constant review and track that everyone is doing right things at right time. But this was not easy especially in remote learning. Various sorts of issues used to create hurdles and interruptions. Internet cut out, non-availability of members and any personal issues used to create intermissions. Keeping the whole group together was a challenge. Most of the times during group meetings 1 or 2 members used to miss the meetings because of some personal reasons or sometimes they didn’t check their calendars for the scheduled meetings. So, to overcome this we used to ask every member about their availability for the group meeting. And when everyone used to post their availability time in the group chat, then a meeting was scheduled. This measure solved our problem up to some extend as meeting was setup on the availability time of every group member so that all the members can attend the meeting at their convenience.</p>
          
          <h1>New Skills and Experiences</h1>
          <p>We have developed more programming skills as in order to make all the features working lots of programming skills were required. So, working for that has helped us to acquire good knowledge and enhanced our skills. Moreover, creating mock-ups was also a new experience for us. Making the initial design for the website was really interesting part through which we have acquired efficient designing skills also. Using trello board for all the assignment updates was also a new experience. Moreover, we have learned how to collaborate a team in more efficient way. As in the starting, we were not able to cope up due to some issues but later now managing things in a way that suits everyone worked a lot for us. And this time we not only have to design the features but also have to implement them fully which was bit tricky and new experience for us. </p>
          
          <h1>Plans</h1>
          <p>Plans are more likely to change, whenever we start implementing better things in the actual project. So, the same happened with us. When we were at the beginning of the project we decided to build a healthy eating recipe website. But while exploring the other products in the market we came with the idea of adding more interesting things to make this project more interesting and user friendly. As our project is based on helping people to eat healthy food and to maintain their BMI (Body Mass Index) which was not possible by providing diet only. Physical exercise and healthy routine plays a vital role in controlling body weight. Talking about timetable, most of the tasks took more than actual time to complete which was really tricky thing to handle. But as per now, everything is on right track and every member is doing their part so there is no need to make further changes into anything. Most of the things were as expected but while implementing the design for the website that we made earlier, we were not able to implement it as such. So, we made many changes to the design to get the desired outcome. We will not make much changes if we have further time as our project is satisfactory to all the team members and we have executed all the features in the best way we can.</p>
