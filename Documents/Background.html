    <h2>PROJECT MOTIVATION</h2>

    <p>We were motivated and empowered to create Slim &Fit website after coming to terms with the bleak
        reality of COVID-19 and how it has seized away the freedom from our youth and the elderly. Therefore, we
        wanted to create a health and fitness related website which would allow the users to carry out their
        usual routine despite not being able to physically visit their local gyms and other health related
        facilities. This website would be the most perfect website for all the health-conscious people who want
        to still pursue with their fitness and health related goals despite being struck by this pandemic. We
        assure to provide the most incredible health services to allow individuals to stay fit and healthy.
        <br>
        <br>
        Not many people are self-driven to look after themselves, especially when they are surrounded by such
        catastrophe. So, our primary goal is to instigate enthusiasm and motivation amongst people to stay
        healthy regardless of the situation. By creating the website, we will definitely be going above and
        beyond our current IT knowledge and skills as we will learn and explore new technologies in each and
        every stage of the development starting from the design stage all the way up to the evaluation stage. We
        as a group will enrich our IT skills in different areas such as designing, programming, communication
        and writing skills.
        <br>
        <br>
        We did not use our IT idea from last semester, but we were inspired from our project that we did in UCD.
        As a group we merged the two themes together, which included fitness and health and thus came up with
        the idea to create Fit & Slim website. This is the most perfect website which instils a level of
        motivation amongst people to stay healthy. Although our UCD project was not that advanced or complexed
        but we gathered the inspiration from that project and used that as a foundation to build upon the
        project. Furthermore, we have added some incredible and advanced features such as goal setter, workout
        tracker, memberships , services and fitness products to appeal to the user’s interest, consequently
        allowing the users to stay motivated in the face of the outbreak of deadly virus.

            My interest in this project was to create a dynamic website offering useful services to
            those who
            have been adversely affected by the closing of the fitness services due to the pandemic.
            This
            included offering online services via pre-recorded videos, one on one consultations with the
            personal trainers, workout tracker, goal setter and fitness products.<br><br>Prior to this
            project, I was
            not that confident with using programming languages such as java, java-script, bootstrap or
            php, but
            upon the completion of the website, I felt a lot more confident and content about what I had
            achieved. Furthermore, I initially struggled with familiarizing myself with using
            GitHub and AWS but
            through the support of the other members as well as a bit of personal research, I easily
            overcame
            that challenge and was able to work on my own. I have acquired and improved on various
            skills
            through completing this project such as my communication and writing skills. Those two
            features are
            fundamental in being able to effectively communicate ideas and put our vision into
            reality.<br>
            <br>
            Additionally, another most important skill that I wanted to achieve was to enhance my
            programming
            skill. Through making certain pages of the website and helping my team members, I was able
            to
            achieve my goal that I had set earlier for myself prior to starting the project. There was
            not one
            specific role that I was assigned to do for the whole project as we all shared the roles
            equally.
            For instance, at the start I was helping the team with organising the meetings and achieving
            the
            deadlines. Then I took up the role of a writing about the project for the assignment.
            Additionally, I also made visual diagrams on Lucid chart to create the mock-ups as well as
            right the user stories for each of them. I also contributed to the actual development of the
            website by making parts of the website such as the goal setter.

            <p>
                I have always been interested in making a fitness and health related website and what
                better time to make it then during this pandemic. I believe due to the
                COVID-restrictions people have been unable to look after themselves as they should
                because most of the fitness services are closed. My interest towards the project not
                only fulfils my desire of making a dynamic website but also helping people during this
                time of need when better initiatives and incentives need to be put into place to
                motivate and facilitate the youth to look after themselves.
                <br><br>
                Before this project, I did
                not have much idea about the different programming languages that we would need to learn
                in order to create the website. However, upon the completion of the project, I was able
                to confidently work with java, java-script, bootstrap and php. Apart from enhancing my
                programming skills, I have also improved a lot on time management. Being part of a group
                requires a good commitment of time management skills and organizing skills. Through
                being in the group and working with different members to achieve one goal has been a
                phenomenal experience. I wasn’t just given one task to complete, I had several roles in
                the group that I respectively performed such as setting up GitHub and AWS. Apart from
                that I have made several contributions in making the actual website which consists of
                helping out with different webpages and making conceptual lucid chart diagrams.

I was having my interest in creating different webpages before commencing the assignment. But while working on assignment my interest has been gained towards designing. When I worked on lucid chart for the mock-ups, it was very interesting for me. Later on, when I worked for validation test, I found that my interest is growing in designing. Now, designing the interface for a website sounds very interesting for me and because of pre-planned design it becomes easy to create an actual website and implement all the features. Now, I have gained confidence in creating design for websites and my I have gained more knowledge about the CSS in which we can impliment number of different styles. Moreover, my problem solving ability has been enhanced as now I have worked with the group and helping each other has given me a new experience.

            The interest I had was creating a website in a team environment, building it from the ground
            up. I had basic skills with html 5, CSS and some programming languages. These have been more
            developed when creating the website. The use of GitHub was something I had to get my head
            around and figure out, with some hiccups there was no further problem!
            <br><br>
            The role I had in the project was creating different aspects of the website and the Teams
            Trello card. The website development role was writing the code to create the structure of
            the website that we had designed in the mock-ups and implement them on to the website. I
            created the services pages and assisted with other aspects throughout the website.

                My interest in this project was to create a website that can relate to the current
                pandemic situation. As currently most of the people are unable to look after themselves
                as people find it difficult to exercise while in lockdown. The main aim of this project
                was to create something which can help people during this covid pandemic.
                <br><br>
                Before commencing this project, I had a very basic level knowledge of most of the
                programming languages which was required to create a website. This project helps me to
                develop an understanding of programming languages which includes HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript. Additionally, GitHub was something new that I learned during the completion
                of this fitness project.
                <br><br>
                I created the registration and login page and assisted others in various parts of the

                My interest in this topic stems from my personal experience with health and fitness that
                comes from being in the military.
                As I have spent several years a junior officer in the Army, I have picked up a lot of
                good habits revolving around healthy eating
                and regular exercise to maintain physical and mental wellbeing. I have also had a lot of
                exposure to methods of motivating and
                encouraging people to succeed, and wanted to incorporate this into our project.
                <br><br>
                Prior to commencing the project I had very basic HTML and Java programming skills, and a
                rough understanding of how to use

                how to build a website with HTML and CSS,
                as well as how to incorporate JS functions into HTML code. Additionally, the use of AWS

    <h2>Aims and Goals</h2>
    <p>
        <b>“Turn Fat into FIT”</b><br>
        This is the main aim of the Fit&Slim project. In this current pandemic situation we want people
        to stay healthy and physically fit by just sitting at home. The aim of this project is to help
        people on daily basis to set their goals and also track them. Providing personalised services
        can manifold the effects. Moreover, providing healthy products at their doorsteps can be more
        beneficial.
    </p>
    <p>The first aim is to make sure that the user engages with some sort of physical exercise on daily
        basis. To do this, our website will provide goal setter and goal tracker. Goal setter will help
        the user to set daily goals on regular basis on the other hand tracker will help them to make
        sure whether the goal is achieved or not. This feature will help the user to get motivated and
        help them to participate in some sort of activities which will provide them healthy mind and
        body.</p>
    <p>Other aim is to provide personal services at home. Through this services page users can access to
        workout videos, daily plans, diet charts and recipes. Moreover, this service also includes
        personal training sessions with trainers and dieticians. Most of the time people need one on one
        guidance to maintain their health and share their problems. So, this feature will help the user
        to get professional guidance to maintain their wellbeing.</p>
    <p>
        Additionally, providing fitness products is one of the key feature. As we all know that most of
        the people like snacks and stuff during their leisure time. So our website will provide healthy
        snacks which will help the user to maintain their health and enjoy the munching of snacks at
        same time. Our website will provide eatables as well as other equipments like yoga mats,
        skipping ropes, exercising tools and many more. This all will help user to get everything under
        one roof in order to maintain their health. They need not to go to other places or sites to get
        all the required things. Everything will be provided to the user at one click. The main aim of
        our website is to keep the user as motivated as we can to help them be fit and fine.

    </p>
    <p> Our fourth main feature is the workout tracker. This is a super cool feature which allows the users to
        understand how well they are doing in terms of their fitness by filling in the required fields and getting a
        personalized summary. Just to name a few features, users will be asked to enter their calorie intake, amount of
        sleep and exercise to see a customized generated report. However, if the user wants to add more features, they
        wont be able to unless they are logged in. if they are new to the website, they would be re-directed to the
        registration page to register in order to access more features and servcies. </p>
