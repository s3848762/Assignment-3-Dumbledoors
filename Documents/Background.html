    <h2>PROJECT MOTIVATION<h2>

            <p>We were motivated and empowered to create Slim &Fit website after coming to terms with the bleak
                reality of COVID-19 and how it has seized away the freedom from our youth and the elderly. Therefore, we
                wanted to create a health and fitness related website which would allow the users to carry out their
                usual routine despite not being able to physically visit their local gyms and other health related
                facilities. This website would be the most perfect website for all the health-conscious people who want
                to still pursue with their fitness and health related goals despite being struck by this pandemic. We
                assure to provide the most incredible health services to allow individuals to stay fit and healthy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Not many people are self-driven to look after themselves, especially when they are surrounded by such
                catastrophe. So, our primary goal is to instigate enthusiasm and motivation amongst people to stay
                healthy regardless of the situation. By creating the website, we will definitely be going above and
                beyond our current IT knowledge and skills as we will learn and explore new technologies in each and
                every stage of the development starting from the design stage all the way up to the evaluation stage. We
                as a group will enrich our IT skills in different areas such as designing, programming, communication
                and writing skills.
                <br>
                <br>
                We did not use our IT idea from last semester, but we were inspired from our project that we did in UCD.
                As a group we merged the two themes together, which included fitness and health and thus came up with
                the idea to create Fit & Slim website. This is the most perfect website which instils a level of
                motivation amongst people to stay healthy. Although our UCD project was not that advanced or complexed
                but we gathered the inspiration from that project and used that as a foundation to build upon the
                project. Furthermore, we have added some incredible and advanced features such as goal setter, workout
                tracker, memberships , services and fitness products to appeal to the user’s interest, consequently
                allowing the users to stay motivated in the face of the outbreak of deadly virus.

                            My interest in this project was to create a dynamic website offering useful services to
                            those who
                            have been adversely affected by the closing of the fitness services due to the pandemic.
                            This
                            included offering online services via pre-recorded videos, one on one consultations with the
                            personal trainers, workout tracker, goal setter and fitness products.<br><br>Prior to this
                            project, I was
                            not that confident with using programming languages such as java, java-script, bootstrap or
                            php, but
                            upon the completion of the website, I felt a lot more confident and content about what I had
                            achieved. Furthermore, I initially struggled with familiarizing myself with using
                            GitHub and AWS but
                            through the support of the other members as well as a bit of personal research, I easily
                            overcame
                            that challenge and was able to work on my own. I have acquired and improved on various
                            skills
                            through completing this project such as my communication and writing skills. Those two
                            features are
                            fundamental in being able to effectively communicate ideas and put our vision into
                            reality.<br>
                            <br>
                            Additionally, another most important skill that I wanted to achieve was to enhance my
                            programming
                            skill. Through making certain pages of the website and helping my team members, I was able
                            to
                            achieve my goal that I had set earlier for myself prior to starting the project. There was
                            not one
                            specific role that I was assigned to do for the whole project as we all shared the roles
                            equally.
                            For instance, at the start I was helping the team with organising the meetings and achieving
                            the
                            deadlines. Then I took up the role of a writing about the project for the assignment.
                            Additionally, I also made visual diagrams on Lucid chart to create the mock-ups as well as
                            right the user stories for each of them. I also contributed to the actual development of the
                            website by making parts of the website such as the goal setter.

                            <p>
                                I have always been interested in making a fitness and health related website and what
                                better time to make it then during this pandemic. I believe due to the
                                COVID-restrictions people have been unable to look after themselves as they should
                                because most of the fitness services are closed. My interest towards the project not
                                only fulfils my desire of making a dynamic website but also helping people during this
                                time of need when better initiatives and incentives need to be put into place to
                                motivate and facilitate the youth to look after themselves.
                                <br><br>
                                Before this project, I did
                                not have much idea about the different programming languages that we would need to learn
                                in order to create the website. However, upon the completion of the project, I was able
                                to confidently work with java, java-script, bootstrap and php. Apart from enhancing my
                                programming skills, I have also improved a lot on time management. Being part of a group
                                requires a good commitment of time management skills and organizing skills. Through
                                being in the group and working with different members to achieve one goal has been a
                                phenomenal experience. I wasn’t just given one task to complete, I had several roles in
                                the group that I respectively performed such as setting up GitHub and AWS. Apart from
                                that I have made several contributions in making the actual website which consists of
                                helping out with different webpages and making conceptual lucid chart diagrams.

                            The interest I had was creating a website in a team environment, building it from the ground
                            up. I had basic skills with html 5, CSS and some programming languages. These have been more
                            developed when creating the website. The use of GitHub was something I had to get my head
                            around and figure out, with some hiccups there was no further problem!
                            <br><br>
                            The role I had in the project was creating different aspects of the website and the Teams
                            Trello card. The website development role was writing the code to create the structure of
                            the website that we had designed in the mock-ups and implement them on to the website. I
                            created the services pages and assisted with other aspects throughout the website.

                                pandemic situation. As currently most of the people are unable to look after themselves
                                as people find it difficult to exercise while in lockdown. The main aim of this project
                                was to create something which can help people during this covid pandemic.
                                <br><br>
                                Before commencing this project, I had a very basic level knowledge of most of the
                                programming languages which was required to create a website. This project helps me to
                                develop an understanding of programming languages which includes HTML, CSS and
                                JavaScript. Additionally, GitHub was something new that I learned during the completion
                                of this fitness project.

                                I created the registration and login page and assisted others in various parts of the

                                My interest in this topic stems from my personal experience with health and fitness that
                                comes from being in the military.
                                As I have spent several years a junior officer in the Army, I have picked up a lot of
                                good habits revolving around healthy eating
                                and regular exercise to maintain physical and mental wellbeing. I have also had a lot of
                                exposure to methods of motivating and
                                encouraging people to succeed, and wanted to incorporate this into our project.
                                <br><br>
                                Prior to commencing the project I had very basic HTML and Java programming skills, and a
                                rough understanding of how to use
                                AWS and GitHub. This project has greatly developed my confidence and understanding of
                                how to build a website with HTML and CSS,
                                as well as how to incorporate JS functions into HTML code. Additionally, the use of AWS
                                and GitHub throughout has cemented and
                                improved my knowledge of these tools and how to use them effectively.
                                <br><br>
                                I have been assigned various roles within this project, mostly relating to website
                                construction and design,
                                as well as the overall AWS coordinator for the team.
