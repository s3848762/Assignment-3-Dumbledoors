          The four main positions that I would employ to take my project to the next phase are as follows:<br><br>
          Project manager: I would definitely employ a project manager in my project. This is one of the most crucial
          position that I believe takes the project from nothing to something extraordinary. Project manager would
          usually be responsible for ensuring that everyone is fulfilling their duties and are effectively completing
          their tasks in time. Managing time is something we as a group had struggled with so having a project manager
          overview the project will reduce the chances of delays within the project. they will further ensure that the
          team has all the right amount of resources they need in order to enhance the Fit&Slim website.<br><br>
          Programmer: Additionally, being able to put the visual representation of a website via mock-ups requires a
          role which could put the vision into reality. A programmer with all the necessary knowledge as well as the
          knowledge of various different programming language is a must in our project as they would ensure that the can
          provide maximums functionality and ease to the users who will be interacting the website. Without a
          programmer, there is no way that we would be able to carry out with our requirement as only a programmer can
          develop a well-designed and fully functional website.<br><br>
          Technical expert: Since our project evolves around making a website, we definitely need a technician who can
          handle all the technical issues that may arise in the development stage. Regardless of how experienced the
          team is there are always technical issues which could arise either unintentionally through negligence or
          intentionally. Having a technical expert who has exceptional knowledge about handling unwanted and unexpected
          events during a web-development project is an asset to the team. So, I would definitely employ a technical
          expert who is able to manage technical issues to reduce delays and panics that may be caused during the
          project.<br><br>
          PR manager: Lastly, after the completion of the website, we will need a PR manager to promote the website and
          appeal to the audienceâ€™s interest. PR managers are a media and public relation professionals who responsible
          for planning and directing the creation of material that will maintain or enhance the public image of the
          product or a service. With the appropriate marketing and advertising skills, we will be able to effectively
          present our website in the market to maximize customers. They will be responsible for ensuring that all the
          correct marketing skills are carried out so that Slim&Fit gains all the necessary popularity it needs to run
          in the market and become one of the best health and fitness related websites.<br><br>
